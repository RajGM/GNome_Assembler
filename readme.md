# phi X 174

### The phi X 174 (or Î¦X174) bacteriophage is a single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) virus and the first DNA-based genome to be sequenced.

# Problem Description:

## Input:
### A collection of Strings called reads of the original genome. Each read is a sub-string of the original genome(Genome can be circular also).

## Output:
### A string S of minimum length that cantains all the strings(reads) given in the input as its sub-strings.
